# MathView
Simple third-party view library written in `Kotlin` to ease displaying math formulas using [jqMath](https://mathscribe.com/author/jqmath.html). 

## About jqMath
jqMath is a JavaScript module that makes it easy to put formatted mathematical expressions in web pages. It uses a simple TeX-like syntax, with MathML semantics and is roughly 5 times faster than MathJax (which is actually much bigger). jqMath is lightweight, fast and concise. It is standards-based and cross-browser, using MathML when available, else simple HTML and CSS, and avoiding pixel-map images. Thus pages load quickly, and expressions can be resized by the user, or easily passed to screen reading, graphing, or computer algebra software.
